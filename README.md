### Code samples generation for Java

This tool generates relatively random Java code samples.

Currently, the following constructs are supported:
* Classes with fields and methods
* Primitive types
* Variables instantiation
* If blocks
* For loops
* Method calls
* Inheritance

To customize samples generation see `UserConfiguration` class and set your own bounds.
